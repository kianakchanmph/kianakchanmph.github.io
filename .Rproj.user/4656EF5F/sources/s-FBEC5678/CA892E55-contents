# Welcome to Kiana Chan's Website! 



## About Kiana
Hello! My name is Kiana Chan, and I am a Master of Public Health (MPH) Candidate in my last year at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, in the Department of Epidemiology. I am also pursuing a Certificate in Public Health Research Methods. 

Outside of classes and work, I enjoy biking, hiking, and running. Central Park and Prospect Park are two of my go-to parks, but I also enjoy getting out of the city when I can to catch the fall foliage and escape in nature.

I also enjoy spending time with my grandma, who lives in Chinatown, New York City! I'm always so lucky to be surprised with a delciious meal whenever I visit.
